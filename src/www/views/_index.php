        1. JS can't sort arrays.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p class="fs-4">
        JS has method called 'sort', but this method works wrong. As an exaple if you create an array with
        positive and negetive numbers [1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2] and then call the method you get this: [-1, -2, -3,
        1, 2, 3].
        You can test it right now, just put this <code class="theme-atom-one-dark language-javascript">[1, 3, 2,
            -1, -3, -2].sort()</code> to your browser
        console (F12 or RBM &#x21d2; Inspect &#x21d2 Console).

        I think that's enough for now.
